Description: Efficient implementation of building blocks for training torch networks in R.
    This includes optimizers from LibTorch and an implementation of the train-predict logic
    in C++. The only requirement for the network architecture is that it is jit-compiled,
    either via tracing or by defining it in 'TorchScript'.
